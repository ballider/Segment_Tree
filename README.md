# Segment_Tree
Segment Tree. What is it and how to use it. Code examples.

I divided the trees into two parts. With single operations and mass operations. The main difference is that single operations affect only one element, and mass operations affect a segment of elements.

Each folder describes in more detail about each of these trees and provides code examples.
